### ðŸ˜Ž

I'm Fernando L. Canizo, a parent of three, programmer of many, gardener of too many, builder of several, handyman when it's required.

Currently working full time on [CSW Consultores Ambientales](https://github.com/cswcl/), but I'm available for part-time projects or fun and interesting projects.

I'm an Open Sources advocate and I try to collaborate whenever I can.
