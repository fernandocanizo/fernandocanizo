I'm Fernando L. Canizo, a parent of three, programmer of many, gardener of too many, builder of several, handyman when it's required.

Currently (2021.01) taking a little time off, but I'll be happy to hear about work propositions be them for `{part,full}`-time projects or fun and interesting ideas.

I'm an Open Sources advocate and I try to collaborate whenever an opportunity arises.

- [GitHub](https://github.com/fernandocanizo/) Code, code, code
- [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/978452/flc) Not a big question hunter, but got a question with 10k views, woa!
- [CodersRank](https://profile.codersrank.io/user/fernandocanizo) Pretty cool graphics, though it doesn't really show everything I do/know
- [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/FernandoCanizo) I like it a lot, but now I have it abandoned
- [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fernando-canizo/) I don't link much
- [Freelancer.com](http://www.freelancer.com/u/FernandoCanizo.html) An old version of me, but check the nice comments from contractors ;)
- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/fcanizo) I don't twit much
- [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/ferlucamza/) I rarely post a photo and when I do, it's something else
- [Medium](https://medium.com/@fernandocanizo) Just claps and highlights, no writtings yet
